      ====== PHASE 3: SOCIAL ENGINEERING CONTENT (Days 11-12) ======
      
      Email Strategy: Urgent Wire Transfer Request
      
      Sender: David Mitchell, Chairman of the Board
      Recipient: {{ executive_name }}
      Subject: URGENT - Confidential - Wire Transfer Approval Needed
      
      "James,
      
      Due to the confidential nature of our pending {{ business_context }}, 
      I'm reaching out with an urgent request. The acquiring company requires 
      a $2.5M wire transfer to escrow by end of business TODAY to demonstrate 
      commitment and lock in the deal terms.
      
      This is time-sensitive and cannot go through normal channels due to 
      confidentiality agreements. The deal would be jeopardized if this becomes 
      public knowledge before official announcement.
      
      Please wire the funds from corporate reserves to the escrow account:
      
      Account: [Attacker-controlled account details]
      Routing: [Attacker-controlled routing]
      
      Confirm receipt of this email immediately. Do not discuss with finance 
      team - this needs to remain between us and legal counsel.
      
      Call me after you've arranged the wire: [Attacker phone number]
      
      David"
      
      ====== PHASE 4: DELIVERY & EXECUTION (Days 13-14) ======
      
      Primary Approach: CEO/Executive Assistant
      
      1. Email to CEO
         - Spoofed from board chairman
         - Emphasizes confidentiality and urgency
         - References pending acquisition details
         - Provides payment instructions
      
      2. Follow-up to Executive Assistant
         - Different sender: "Legal counsel with transaction details"
         - Emphasizes time sensitivity
         - Requests calendar booking/agenda item
         - Includes "official" transaction documents
      
      3. Phone Confirmation
         - Call spoofed phone number (caller ID spoofing)
         - Confirm wire transfer arrangement
         - Answer any questions
         - Redirect to "escrow" account
      
      4. False Documentation
         - Create fake acquisition agreement
         - Include legitimate company letterheads
         - Reference real board members and legal firms
         - Include standard acquisition clauses
      
      ====== PHASE 5: WIRE FRAUD EXECUTION ======
      
      Wire Transfer Instructions:
      - Amount: $2.5M (significant but not suspicious for large deal)
      - Recipient: Attacker-controlled account
      - Urgency: EOB delivery mandate
      - Justification: Confidential escrow arrangement
      
      Money Laundering:
      - Immediate transfer to multiple intermediate accounts
      - Quick movement through multiple jurisdictions
      - Use money mule networks for cash-out
      - Convert to cryptocurrency at exchange
      
      ====== PHASE 6: POST-EXPLOITATION ======
      
      Cover Actions:
      - Delay in "deal completion" cited as normal business
      - Reference external advisor delays
      - Cite regulatory review processes
      - Stall communications
      
      Victim Realization:
      - When deal falls through, CEO realizes fraud
      - By then, funds are dispersed
      - Wire instructions traced back to spoofed accounts
      - Minimal recovery likelihood
      
      ESTIMATED IMPACT:
      - Financial Loss: $2.5M minimum (often $5M+)
      - Company Reputation: Significant (CEO defrauded)
      - Insurance: May cover portion
      - Law Enforcement: FBI/SEC involvement
      - Recovery Rate: <5%
